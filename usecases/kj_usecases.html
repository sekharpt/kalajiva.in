  <h1>Kalajiva: SICCI Use Cases</h1>

  <div class="use-case">
    <h2>1. Flood Protection for Sugarcane and Paddy Farmers (FPOs/SHGs/Bankers)</h2>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Late-monsoon floods in Tamil Nadu and Kerala can wipe out standing crops, disrupting not only farmers’ income but also the supply chain for food processors and mills.</p>
    <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> FPOs and SHGs offer parametric flood insurance to their members, triggered by official rainfall thresholds (e.g., &gt;200mm in 5 days as per IMD data). Farmers receive automatic payouts within days—no paperwork, no waiting.</p>
    <p><strong>Who Pays:</strong> The premium is paid by the farmer (potentially subsidized partially by FPO/SHG or bundled with input loans via partner banks).</p>
    <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Farmers get quick liquidity to replant or offset losses.</li>
      <li>FPOs/SHGs add real value for their members and can negotiate better bulk rates or receive a referral fee.</li>
      <li>Bankers reduce agri-loan defaults (as insured farmers are more likely to repay after a climate shock).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="quote">“Imagine if, after the next flood, your farmer members or loan customers could recover in days—not months—without chasing claims.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="use-case">
    <h2>2. Drought Cover for Crop Sowing and Input Purchase (FPOs/SHGs/Tech Providers)</h2>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Post-monsoon dry spells in November affect Rabi sowing, leading to lower yields and cash flow issues for both farmers and FPOs.</p>
    <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Parametric drought insurance pays out if rainfall falls below a critical threshold (e.g., &lt;40mm in 30 days), determined by reliable weather station or satellite data. FPOs partner with Kalajiva to bundle this policy at sowing or input distribution time.</p>
    <p><strong>Who Pays:</strong> The farmer, bundled with seed/fertilizer payments; possible FPO pre-negotiated group discount.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Farmers secure funds for emergency irrigation or resowing, reducing risk of total crop loss.</li>
      <li>FPOs/SHGs enhance their member services and earn a commission on sales.</li>
      <li>Tech providers can supply sensor/weather data (with Kalajiva as the insurance sales enabler), creating a win-win ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="quote">“FPOs and tech partners can easily offer drought protection—every time a member buys seed.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="use-case">
    <h2>3. Supply Chain Stability for Retailers via Supplier Insurance (Retail Companies/Bankers/Tech Providers)</h2>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Food processing and retail companies (dairy, grains, perishables) face frequent supply disruptions in TN/Kerala during cyclones, floods, or extreme heat, impacting their ability to stock shelves and meet demand.</p>
    <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Retailers/food processors partner with Kalajiva to encourage (or incentivize) their farmer suppliers to take specific parametric policies—e.g., flood or heatwave cover. Kalajiva digitizes policy purchase workflows and ties payouts to objective weather triggers.</p>
    <p><strong>Who Pays:</strong> Suppliers (farmers/FPOs), perhaps with partial premium support from the retailer as a loyalty incentive.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Retailers enjoy more reliable supply and reduced emergency sourcing costs after disasters.</li>
      <li>Suppliers recover faster from climate shocks, supporting on-time deliveries.</li>
      <li>Kalajiva earns commission on every policy enabled, while reducing operational overhead for all parties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="quote">“Parametric insurance can be bundled into supplier contracts—so when the next cyclone delays your milk or grain deliveries, your supply chain gets moving again fast.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="use-case">
    <h2>4. Livestock Heat Stress Cover for Dairy Cooperatives (FPOs/SHGs/Technology Providers)</h2>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Heatwaves during October–December can reduce milk yields, causing income loss for dairy farmers and supply shortages for processors.</p>
    <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Dairy FPOs/SHGs enroll members in heat index-based insurance—if temperatures spike above a pre-set level for multiple days, payouts are made automatically, helping farmers buy feed, medicine, or maintain herd health.</p>
    <p><strong>Who Pays:</strong> The dairy farmer (premium often paid at milk collection or via FPO facilitation).</p>
    <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Farmers smooth income, cooperatives ensure more stable supply.</li>
      <li>Kalajiva manages the entire enrollment, earning commission on policy sales.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="quote">“Dairy supply chains are vulnerable to rising heat—why not protect your farmers and your inventory?”</p>
