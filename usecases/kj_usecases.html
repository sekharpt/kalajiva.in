<h1>SICCI Use Cases Aligned with Kalajiva’s Model</h1>

<section>
  <h2>1. Flood Protection for Sugarcane and Paddy Farmers (FPOs/SHGs/Bankers)</h2>
  <p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br />
    Late-monsoon floods in Tamil Nadu and Kerala can wipe out standing crops, disrupting not only farmers’ income but also the supply chain for food processors and mills.</p>

  <p><strong>Who Pays:</strong> The premium is paid by the farmer (potentially subsidized partially by FPO/SHG or bundled with input loans via partner banks).</p>

  <p>FPOs/SHGs add real value for their members and can negotiate better bulk rates or receive a referral fee.</p>

  <p>Bankers reduce agri-loan defaults (as insured farmers are more likely to repay after a climate shock).</p>

  <blockquote>“Imagine if, after the next flood, your farmer members or loan customers could recover in days—not months—without chasing claims.”</blockquote>

<section>
  <h2>2. Post-monsoon Dry Spell Protection for Rabi Sowing</h2>
  <p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br />
    Post-monsoon dry spells in November affect Rabi sowing, leading to lower yields and cash flow issues for both farmers and FPOs.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Supply Chain Stability for Retailers via Supplier Insurance (Retail Companies/Bankers/Tech Providers)</h2>
  <p><strong>Who Pays:</strong> Suppliers (farmers/FPOs), perhaps with partial premium support from the retailer as a loyalty incentive.</p>

  <p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br />
    Heatwaves during October–December can reduce milk yields, causing income loss for dairy farmers and supply shortages for processors.</p>

  <p><strong>Who Pays:</strong> The dairy farmer (premium often paid at milk collection or via FPO facilitation).</p>

  <blockquote>“Dairy supply chains are vulnerable to rising heat—why not protect your farmers and your inventory?”</blockquote>
